# Complex
This was an introductory lab I used to familarize myself with Java.
Here we take 2 hard coded Complex numbers and display methods that perform 3 math operations
(Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication)

Skills Learned: Creating setters/getters, working with private data types, and displaying outputs
